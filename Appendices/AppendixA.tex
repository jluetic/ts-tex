\lhead{Appendix A. \emph{Lorentz angle measurement in Pixel detector}} 

Lorentz angle is measured by using grazing angle method described in detail in \cite{Henrich}. From the individual signals in the detector, using reconstruction algorithms, tracks of muon candidates are obtained. From these reconstructed track it is possible to extract the entry point ($x_{reco}$,$y_{reco}$) to each layer of the detector. 
Distance between reconstructed entry point and the actual hit in the detector is then defined as ($\Delta x$,$\Delta y$):
\begin{equation}
\Delta x = x_{center}-x_{reco}
\end{equation} 
\begin{equation}
\Delta y = y_{center}-y_{reco}
\end{equation} 

where ($x_{center}$,$y_{center}$) is the position of each individual pixel center in the observed cluster. Drift of the electrons can be determined using three impact angles defined in the following way:

\begin{equation}
\text{tan} \alpha = \frac{p_z}{p_x}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\text{tan} \beta = \frac{p_z}{p_y}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\text{tan} \gamma = \frac{p_x}{p_y}
\end{equation}

where $p_x$,$p_y$ and $p_z$ are momentum components in local coordinate system which are calculated from reconstructed track parameters (Fig. \ref{fig:kut}). \\

\end{figure}
Drift of the electrons depends on the depth at which electrons are created. Depth of the electron production $z$ and drift due to magnetic field $d$ are defined:

\begin{equation}
z = \Delta y \text{ tan}\beta
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
d=\Delta x-\Delta y \text{ tan}\gamma
\end{equation}

This procedure is repeated for each pixel over many tracks in order to obtain charge drift distance vs depth. The Lorentz angle is the slope of this distribution.  Without a magnetic field, the
direction of the clusters largest extension is parallel to the track projection on the (x, y) plane. The average drift distance of an electron created at a certain depth is obtained from Fig. \ref{fig:2D}. A linear fit is
performed over the total depth of the detector excluding the first and last 50 $\mu$ where the charge drift is systematically displaced by the finite size of the pixel cell (Fig:\ref{fig:profile}).

In order to obtain a good measurement, it is important to use clean tracks. Therefore, it required to have a well reconstructed muon tracks with $p_T>3$GeV and $\chi^2/ndof<2$ which are required to have shallow impact angle with respect to local $y$ direction with cluster size of at least 4 pixels in this direction. Summary of the selection criteria can be found in table \ref{tab:sel}.

Figure \ref{fig:La2012} shows how Lorentz angle changes with integrated luminosity. Results are shown for 23fb$^{-1}$ of delivered luminosity in 2012. Increase in Lorentz angle measured with grazing angle method has been observed in all layers, with largest effect (~6\%) visible in layer 1 over this period of data taking.
