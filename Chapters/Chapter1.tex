The standard model of particle physics tries to give an answer to the questions what is the matter made of and how does it interact. The predictions of the standard model have been tested many times and various precision measurements were performed at different experiments. Nevertheless every time the standard model predictions were correct. The only missing link, the long sought Higgs boson, was found in 2012, with its properties measured in the following years thus completing the picture of elementary particles. However, standard model still leaves some unexplained phenomena, e.g. neutrino oscillations, matter-antimatter asymmetry, the existence of dark matter and dark energy, giving rise to the physics beyond standard model. The sensitivity to such processes in the high energy physics experiments strongly depends on the precise measurements of known processes. In such measurements, poorly known yields and kinematics of the known processes would lead to high uncertainties, and reducing the sensitivity of the experiment.
